# Python-Assignment1
Task 1 and  Task 2 , both are in this repository
Task 1 - Use of operators
The program asks for input of the two numbers.  I have given float in case non integers are input
The program then checks which input has been provided. Based on that the respective operation is called out
If the right operation is not chosen the system returns "invalid input"
Only in case of division the system checks if the denominator is zero.  if so, it returns a message saying " Zero in denominator is not allowed"
#Task 2 - take first name and second name as input
use the input command to take input. Since input by default expects a string, no assingment is required
Use the addition to concatenate and print
